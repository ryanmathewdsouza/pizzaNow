HTML/CSS/JavaScript Assessment
You have been approached by a web design agency.  You have been asked to build a working prototype of a webpage.  A pizza delivery company wants you to build a page offering clients a selection of pizzas, you can come up with the pizza varieties and may use other sources to assist you.  The expectation from the client is that the details of the pizza should be accompanied by an image and that each pizza can be sold with:
Thin Italian Base
Stone Crust Base
Cheese Stuffed Crust Base
Vegan Base
Gluten Free Base
With different sizes to offer:
Small – 8”
Medium – 12”
Large – 16”
Pizzanormous – 20”
Sides can include:
Salad
Garlic Bread
Cheesy Garlic Bread
Coleslaw
Chicken Wings
Drinks are available in litre bottles:
Pepsi
Pepsi Max
Dr Pepper
7-up
Tango

You must be able to offer at least 15 different pizza options, with at least 2 vegan options and 2 gluten-free options.  You also must add to this list a 50/50 option, where a customer is able to select a single base and choose between the 15+ options two halves of pizza to join as one.
You may come up with the name of the organisation and the colour format, but please take care not to have contrast clashing colours.  You will need to present your product in three versions, showing different colours and font styles, but the overall format of the page can be the same.
The final requirement is that the page must be dynamic.  So, whether you are using a mobile phone or your home smart TV, the appearance is professionally displayed.  
You will not be expected to build a working login or payment screen, but the basket detailing the customer’s order needs to be working.  Feel free to review competitors’ sites, but do not emulate or duplicate any of them, we want our own brand.
You will be expected to provide a working demonstration by 16th June.  Please upload your files to GitHub and provide a link once it has been completed.   You will be expected to have:
An HTML file
A CSS file
A JavaScript file
Good luck and let’s see how you manage.
